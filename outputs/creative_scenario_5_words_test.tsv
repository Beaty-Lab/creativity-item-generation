She'd signed up for it, thinking it would be an easy additional credit, but the rigorous physical tests are proving more challenging than she anticipated. Furthermore, her failing performance is not just hurting her grade, but also her self-esteem. She wants to pass the course but the final assessment, a significant run in the park, is only two weeks away. Both her roommates, Michael and Emma, offer help. Michael is a track athlete who promises rigorous training regime, but his techniques are dated and exceptionally demanding which Sarah fears might risk her health. Emma, on the other hand, offers a modern, scientifically backed running and diet program, which has its advantages but is time-consuming and could potentially affect Sarah's studies. Sarah does not know what to do.
